Brainfux - Brainfuck interpreter written in C++.

It's a brainfuck interpreter that runs the input written in input file and creates GAS-compatible assembly code for it.

Key-input(,) hasn't yet been implemented for the assembly output. It hasn't even been tested for the interpreter itself.

Using code found from https://github.com/apankrat/bff/blob/master/samples/mandelbrot.b as test input.
